# Landmark Book app 

## About The Project

I learned the basic of TableView and its method. Also I learned basic of Cocoa Touch class. <br><br>

#  Artbook app

## I learned and used CoreData. I have created a new entity called "Paintings" and defined its attributes. Then, I added or removed a new painting to/from it.

# TravelBook app

## I learned and used MapKit, CoreLocation. I added a marker to a specific point on the map if it was pressed for more than 3 seconds, and saved it using CoreData. Then, I displayed the saved locations on a TableView.
